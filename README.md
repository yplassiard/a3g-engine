# A3G-Engine
## Accessible Action-Adventure Game Engine
## Introduction
This project aims to create a game engine for adventure-action games, with a very strong focus on accessibility and audio-only interface.
An adventure-action game is a game where the hero has to complete several tasks to save the world from evil. Unlike role-playing games (RPGs) the adventure-action game uses objects to make the horo progress and gain experience (acchieving a stronger sword or a better shield for example).
